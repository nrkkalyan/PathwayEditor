<h1>Third Party Licenses</h1>

<h2>ACME Labs</h2>
<p>
The following classes were originally taken from the ACME Labs Java page
<code>http://www.acme.com/java</code>:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Acme.IntHashtable</li>
<li>Acme.JPM.Encoders.ImageEncoder</li>
<li>Acme.JPM.Encoders.GifEncoder</li>
</ul>
<p>
These classes are used within the yFiles package <code>y.io</code> and therefore
the 3rd party license applies to the yFiles distribution types 
yFiles Viewer and yFiles Complete.
<br/>
The 3rd party license does not apply to the distributions yFiles Basic and yFiles 
Layout.
