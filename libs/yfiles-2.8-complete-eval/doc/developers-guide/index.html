<h1>yFiles Developer's Guide Missing</h1>
<p>
The yFiles Developer's Guide is not installed yet. It can be obtained from the same
source as the yFiles class library itself. The Developer's Guide comes as a zipped
archive file. To install it, simply unpack the archive to the yFiles documentation 
directory <a href="..">&lt;yFilesDir>/doc</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Note: during installation you may be asked by your unzip
program whether or not to overwrite the file <tt>developers-guide/index.html</tt>. 
In that case answer yes.
