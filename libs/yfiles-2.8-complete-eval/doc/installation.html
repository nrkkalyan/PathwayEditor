<h1>Installing yFiles</h1>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>
To build applications that are based on yFiles Complete or yFiles Viewer
you need to have a Java2 Software Development Kit version 1.4 or higher installed on your system.
To build applications that are based on yFiles Layout or yFiles Basic
it suffices to have a Java2 Software Development Kit version 1.3 installed on your system.
We suggest to use J2SE 1.5 SDK or higher from Sun Microsystems which is
freely downloadable at <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se">http://java.sun.com/j2se</a>
for Microsoft Windows, Linux, and Solaris operating systems.  
</p>
<p>
If you just want to run the provided demo applications it suffices to 
have a Java2 Runtime Environment version 1.4 or higher installed.
We suggest to use the J2SE 5 from Sun Microsystems which is
freely downloadable at <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se">http://java.sun.com/j2se</a>
for Microsoft Windows, Linux, and Solaris operating systems.  
</p><p>
Then you need a program to unpack the yFiles distribution. For that you 
can use <A HREF="http://www.winzip.com">Winzip</A> for Windows. If you are 
on a UNIX platform use the <code>unzip</code> command. 
Alternatively, you can use the <code>jar</code> command that is part of the JSDK 
distribution. 
</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>Unpack the yFiles Zip archive to a directory of your choice. The yFiles
distribution will be contained in a directory prefixed <b>yfiles</b>.</p>

<p>In order to use the yFiles library you need to include the Jar file <b>y.jar</b> in your
Java classpath. </p>

<p>
Optionally, you should download the yFiles Developer's Guide. It can be obtained from the same
source as the yFiles class library itself. The Developer's Guide comes as a zipped
archive file. To install it, simply unpack the archive to the yFiles documentation 
directory <a href=".">&lt;yFilesDir>/doc</a> so that the links contained in the
documentation work. 
</p>
<p>
Note: During installation you may be asked by your unzip program whether or not 
to overwrite the file <tt>developers-guide/index.html</tt>. 
In that case answer "Yes."
</p>

<p>That's basically it. </p>

<p>
You can verify that the installation was correct by running the 
<a href="../src/demo/README.html">demo programs</a> that are part of the yFiles 
distribution.
</p>
<p>
Note that the resource files located in the demo subfolders or the tutorial subfolder 
need to be in your classpath in order for the demos to properly function. 
IDEA users should add at least the resource patterns <code>?*.png;?*.jpg:?*.gif:?*.gml;?*.ygf;?*.graphml;?*.xml;?*.xsl;?*.csv</code>
to their compiler settings.
