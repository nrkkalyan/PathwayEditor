<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
  This demo shows how to apply <code>PartialLayouter</code> to circular layouts. This layout algorithm changes the
  coordinates of a given set of graph elements (called <i>partial</i> elements) and leaves the location and size of all
  other elements (called <i>fixed</i> elements) unchanged. The algorithm aims to place the partial elements such that
  the resulting drawing (including the fixed elements) has a good quality with respect to common graph drawing
  aesthetics.
</p>

<p>
  Partial node elements can be assigned to so called subgraph components. During the layout process each subgraph
  induced by the nodes of a component is first laid out using the specified subgraph layouter. Then, the different
  components are placed one-by-one onto the drawing area such that the number of overlaps among graph elements is small.
  The user can specify different objectives (placement strategies) for finding 'good' positions for subgraph components.
</p>

<p>
  The demo allows to specify fixed and partial elements. Fixed elements are drawn grey and partial elements orange. To
  change the fixed/partial state of elements, select the corresponding elements and click on the "Lock Selected
  Elements" or "Unlock Selected Elements" button. The current state of selected elements can be toggled with a
  mouse-double-click. To start the partial layouter click on the "Apply Partial Layout" button.

<h3>Available Properties</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>Subgraph Layout</dt>
  <dd>
    Specifies the layout algorithm that is applied to the subgraph components. "Unchanged" specifies
    that the layout of the components is not changed.
  </dd>

  <dt>Component Assignment</dt>
  <dd>
    Specifies the subgraph components.<br>
    "Single Nodes" specifies that each partial node is assigned to a separate component.<br>
    "Connected Graphs" specifies that all partial nodes of a connected component are assigned to the
    same subgraph component.
  </dd>

  <dt>Placement Strategy</dt>
  <dd>
    Specifies the placement strategy.<br>
    "Barycenter" specifies that each component should be placed close to the barycenter of its graph
    neighbors. <br>
    "From Sketch" specifies that each component should be placed close to its original position.
  </dd>

  <dt>Edge Routing Style</dt>
  <dd>
    Specifies the edge routing strategy that is used for routing partial edges and edges between
    different subgraph components (so-called inter-edges).<br>
    "Automatic" specifies that the algorithm should automatically choose a suitable routing strategy.
  </dd>

  <dt>Allow Mirroring</dt>
  <dd>
    Allows mirroring of subgraph components to improve the layout quality.
  </dd>

  <dt>Minimal Node Distance</dt>
  <dd>
    Specifies the minimum distance between two adjacent nodes.
  </dd>
</dl>

<h3>Additional Features</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>Duplicate Action</dt>
  <dd>
    Select some nodes and press <code>CTRL + D</code>. This duplicates the selected nodes and integrates
    the new nodes into the graph. The options defined above will be applied to the "new" nodes.
  </dd>

  <dt>Grouping</dt>
  <dd>
    Select some nodes and press <code>CTRL + ALT + G</code>. This inserts a new group node that contains the
    selected elements.
  </dd>
