<p>
  A bus is composed of one or several interconnected <em>hub</em> nodes and the edges that connect the regular nodes
  to the hubs. For clarity, the hubs and edges of the same bus are displayed in a common color.
</p>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>Adding new nodes</dt>
  <dd>
    The palette in the side panel provides two node templates, the upper one for regular nodes and the lower one for
    hubs. To create a node either drag its template from the side panel into the graph view or click at the desired
    location in the view. In the latter case, the new node's type is defined by the selected template.
  </dd>

  <dt>Adding new edges</dt>
  <dd>
    An edge is created by dragging the mouse from the start to the target node. Subsequently, colors are updated to
    reflect the changed bus structure.
  </dd>

  <dt>Removing nodes and edges</dt>
  <dd>
    Selected nodes and edges can be removed using the <code>DELETE</code> key or the corresponding icon in the tool bar.
  </dd>

  <dt>Routing buses</dt>
  <dd>
    The routing algorithm and its properties are available in the tool bar. Use <code>Route All</code> to calculate a
    new routing for all buses and <code>Route Selected</code> to route each bus in which at least one edge, one hub or
    one adjacent regular node is selected.
  </dd>
</dl>

<h3>Settings</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>Automatic routing</dt>
  <dd>
    Triggers an automatic routing for the connections of moved nodes, in which the remainders of the affected buses are
    kept fixed. New single-edge buses are routed automatically, too. Note that the routing algorithm will remove cycles
    and dead-end paths.
  </dd>

  <dt>Grid</dt>
  <dd>
    Affects both the editor and the routing algorithm. If enabled, a grid of the given spacing is shown in the view
    and the algorithm assigns positions on grid coordinates if possible.
  </dd>

  <dt>Orthogonal mode</dt>
  <dd>
    Activates the orthogonal edge creation mode which restricts edge paths of newly created edges to horizontal and
    vertical segments. Orthogonal edges are distinguishable by thicker lines.
  </dd>

  <dt>Snapping</dt>
  <dd>
    Specifies whether snap lines are activated.
  </dd>
</dl>
