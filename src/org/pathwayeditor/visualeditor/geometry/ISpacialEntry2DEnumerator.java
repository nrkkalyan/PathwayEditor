	 * Copies into the supplied array [starting at specified offset] the minimum

	 * The behavior of this method is identical to nextInt() except that in
	 * addition to returning a value, extents information is returned as well.
	 * The information written into the supplied extentsArr parameter consists
	 * of the following:
	 * <blockquote><table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
	 *   <tr>  <th>array index</th>  <th>information written</th>  </tr>

	 * </table></blockquote><p>
	 * NOTE: If the retrieval of minimum bounding rectangle information for
	 * an entry is not important to the user of this enumeration, it is
	 * preferable to call nextInt() instead of nextExtents() for performance
	 * reasons.
	 * @param extentsArr an array to which extent values will be written by this
	 *   method; cannot be null.
	 * @param offset specifies the beginning index of where to write extent
	 *   values into extentsArr; exactly four entries are written starting
	 *   at this index (see above table).
	 * @return the next entry (objKey) in the enumeration.
	 * @exception ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException if extentsArr cannot be
	 *   written to in the index range [offset, offset+3].
